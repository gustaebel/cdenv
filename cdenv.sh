usage: cdenv <command> [<argument> ...]

cdenv will check for a file called $CDENV_FILE every time you cd into a
directory. This file will be sourced in the current environment. This way you
can easily add variables, functions and aliases to the environment or simply
echo a text message each time you enter this directory. The changes to the
environment are cumulative, i.e. the deeper you go in the directory tree each
new $CDENV_FILE's changes are put on top of the others. Once you go back up in
the tree the changes are undone one by one.

Settings are stored in ~/$CDENV_RCFILE:

CDENV_VERBOSE={0|1|2}
    (current: $CDENV_VERBOSE)
    Produce verbose output useful for debugging, default is 0.

CDENV_GLOBAL={0|1}
    (current: $CDENV_GLOBAL)
    If set to 1, the changes in ~/$CDENV_FILE apply globally, regardless of
    whether the current working directory is located inside the home directory,
    default is 1.

CDENV_FILE={basename}
    (current: $CDENV_FILE)
    Use a script filename different from the default .cdenv.sh to prevent
    accidentally executing other people's shell code from a tar file or source
    repo.

CDENV_PATH={directory}[:{directory}]
    (current: $CDENV_PATH)
    A colon-separated list of directories (similar to PATH) with shell scripts
    to load on startup. The files must end with '.sh' and are loaded in
    alphabetical order.
